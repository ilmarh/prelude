Prelude-Manager is a high availability server that accepts secured connections from distributed sensors and/or other Managers and saves received alerts to a media specified by the user (database, log file, mail etc.). The server schedules and establishes the priorities of treatment according to the critical character and the source of the alerts.
The Prelude Manager is a concentrator capable of handling large number of connections, and processing large amounts of alerts. It uses a per client scheduling queues in order to process alerts by severity fairly across clients.
The Prelude Manager comes with multiple plugins like filtering plugins (idmef-criteria, thresholding, etc.) or reporting plugins like the SMTP plugin which automatically sends emails containing a textual description of alerts to a configured list of recipients.
